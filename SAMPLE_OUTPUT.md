## Breast Reduction

### Novel Superomedial Pedicle Technique Reduces NAC Necrosis in High-BMI Patients

**Authors:** Johnson A et al.
**Journal:** Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Dec 2025
**Pearl:** A modified superomedial pedicle with dual dermal flap reinforcement demonstrated 2.1% NAC necrosis rate in patients with BMI >35, compared to 8.3% with standard technique. The technique involves creating two 2cm dermal flaps at the 2 and 10 o'clock positions to augment blood supply while maintaining pedicle mobility.

### Liposomal Bupivacaine for Enhanced Recovery After Reduction Mammaplasty

**Authors:** Smith BJ et al.
**Journal:** Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Nov 2025
**Pearl:** Infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine into the pectoralis major fascia and intercostal spaces reduced opioid consumption by 64% and length of stay by 0.8 days compared to standard local anesthetic. Optimal dosing was 266mg (20mL) divided across four injection sites per breast.

## Rhinoplasty

### Piezoelectric Osteotomy Reduces Postoperative Edema: RCT Results

**Authors:** Chen L et al.
**Journal:** Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery, Jan 2026
**Pearl:** Randomized trial of 120 patients showed piezoelectric osteotomy reduced midface edema by 41% at day 7 compared to traditional osteotomes. Additionally, patients reported 32% less pain in the first 48 hours and returned to work 2.1 days earlier on average.

### New Preservation Technique for Dorsal Aesthetic Lines

**Authors:** Rodriguez M et al.
**Journal:** Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Dec 2025
**Pearl:** "Push-down" technique with preservation of dorsal aesthetic lines showed superior aesthetic outcomes compared to rasping in 85% of blinded evaluations. Key technical point is scoring the nasal bone at predetermined sites before controlled infracture, maintaining periosteal attachments to preserve soft tissue drape.

## DIEP Flap

### Indocyanine Green Angiography Reduces Fat Necrosis Rates

**Authors:** Williams K et al.
**Journal:** Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Oct 2025
**Pearl:** Intraoperative ICG angiography with quantitative perfusion assessment reduced fat necrosis rates from 18% to 7% in DIEP reconstructions. The study identified a perfusion threshold of 45% as the cutoff for viable tissue, allowing for real-time flap trimming and improved outcomes.

### Novel Recipient Vessel Selection Algorithm

**Authors:** Park SH et al.
**Journal:** Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery, Nov 2025
**Pearl:** A CT angiography-based algorithm for recipient vessel selection (internal mammary artery vs thoracodorsal vessels) improved anastomosis time by 23 minutes and reduced flap failure rate to 0.8%. The algorithm prioritizes vessel caliber match within 0.3mm and pedicle length requirements over traditional anatomic landmarks.
